Write a program that implements the functions of the HTTP server version 1.0. The following types of requests must be supported without fail: GET, POST, HEAD, as well as the most common response codes. The server is configured to a specific directory where html files and other subdirectories are located. The main window of the server contains a memo type field, which displays the entire protocol for communicating between the HTTP client and the HTTP server.
